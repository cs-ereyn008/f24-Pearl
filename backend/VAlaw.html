                                        such movement can be made safely. Where the middle lane of a highway is marked
                                        on both sides with a solid line immediately adjacent to a broken line, such
                                        middle lane shall be considered a left-turn or holding lane and it shall be
                                        lawful to drive to the left of such line if the solid line is on the right of
                                        the broken line for the purpose of turning left into any road or entrance,
                                        provided that the vehicle may not travel in such lane further than 150 feet;</p>
                                    <p>6. Wherever a highway is marked with double traffic lines consisting of two
                                        immediately adjacent solid yellow lines, no vehicle shall be driven to the left
                                        of such lines, except (i) when turning left or (ii) in order to pass a

                                        foot-scooter, provided such movement can be made safely; and</p>
                                    <p>7. Whenever a highway is marked with double traffic lines consisting of two
                                        immediately adjacent solid white lines, no vehicle shall cross such lines.</p>

                                    <p>B. The operator of any toll facility or the locality within which such toll
                                        facility is located may install and operate or cause to be installed and

                                        prior to seeking remedies under this section.</p>
                                    <p>C. Information collected by a photo-monitoring system or automatic vehicle
                                        identification system installed and operated pursuant to subsection B shall be
                                        limited exclusively to that information that is necessary for the collection of
                                        unpaid tolls. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all photographs,
                                        microphotographs, electronic images, or other data collected by a
                                        photo-monitoring system or automatic vehicle identification system shall be used
                                        exclusively for the collection of unpaid tolls and shall not (i) be open to the
                                        public; (ii) be sold and/or used for sales, solicitation, or marketing purposes;
                                        (iii) be disclosed to any other entity except as may be necessary for the
                                        collection of unpaid tolls or to a vehicle owner or operator as part of a
                                        challenge to the imposition of a toll; and (iv) be used in a court in a pending
                                        action or proceeding unless the action or proceeding relates to a violation of
                                        this section or upon order from a court of competent jurisdiction. Information
                                        collected under this section shall be purged and not retained later than 30 days
                                        after the collection and reconciliation of any unpaid tolls, administrative
                                        fees, and/or civil penalties. Any entity operating a photo-monitoring system or
                                        automatic vehicle identification system shall annually certify compliance with
                                        this section and make all records pertaining to such system available for
                                        inspection and audit by the Commissioner of Highways or the Commissioner of the
                                        Department of Motor Vehicles or their designee. Any violation of this subsection
                                        shall constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor. In addition to any fines or other
                                        penalties provided for by law, any money or other thing of value obtained as a
                                        result of a violation of this section shall be forfeited to the Commonwealth.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The toll facility operator may impose and collect an administrative fee in
                                        addition to the unpaid toll so as to recover the expenses of collecting the
                                        unpaid toll, which administrative fee shall be reasonably related to the actual
                                        cost of collecting the unpaid toll and not exceed $100 per violation. Such fee
                                        may be levied upon the operator of the vehicle after the first unpaid toll has
                                        been documented. The operator of the vehicle shall pay the unpaid toll and any
                                        administrative fee detailed in an invoice for the unpaid toll issued by a toll
                                        facility operator. If paid within 60 days of notification, the administrative
                                        fee shall not exceed $25.</p>
                                    <p>D. If the matter proceeds to court, the owner or operator of a vehicle shall be
                                        liable for a civil penalty as follows: for a first offense, $50; for a second
                                        offense within one year from the first offense, $100; for a third offense within
                                        two years from the second offense, $250; and for a fourth and any subsequent
                                        offense within three years from the second offense, $500 plus, in each case, the
                                        unpaid toll, all accrued administrative fees imposed by the toll facility
                                        operator, and applicable court costs if the vehicle is found, as evidenced by
                                        information obtained from a photo-monitoring system or automatic vehicle
                                        identification system as provided in this section, to have used such a toll
                                        facility without payment of the required toll.</p>
                                    <p>E. Notwithstanding subsections C and D, for a first conviction of an operator or
                                        owner of a vehicle under this section, the total amount for the first conviction
                                        shall not exceed $2,200, including civil penalties and administrative fees
                                        regardless of the total number of offenses the operator or owner of a vehicle is
                                        convicted of on that date.</p>
                                    <p>F. No summons may be issued by a toll facility operator for a violation of this
                                        section unless the toll facility operator can demonstrate that (i) there was an
                                        attempt to collect the unpaid tolls and applicable administrative fees through
                                        debt collection not less than 30 days prior to issuance of the summons and (ii)
                                        120 days have elapsed since the unpaid toll or, in a summons for multiple
                                        violations, 120 days have elapsed since the most recent unpaid toll noticed on
                                        the summons.</p>
                                    <p>G. Any action under this section shall be brought in the general district court
                                        of the county or city in which the toll facility is located and shall be
                                        commenced within two years of the commission of the offense. Such action shall
                                        be considered a traffic infraction. The attorney for the Commonwealth may
                                        represent the interests of the toll facility operator. Any authorized agent or
                                        employee of a toll facility operator acting on behalf of a governmental entity
                                        shall be allowed the privileges accorded by ยง <a
                                            href='/vacode/16.1-88.03/'>16.1-88.03</a> in such cases.</p>
                                    <p>H. Proof of a violation of this section shall be evidenced by information
                                        obtained from a photo-monitoring system or automatic vehicle identification
                                        system as provided in this section. A certificate, sworn to or affirmed by a
                                        technician employed or authorized by the operator of a toll facility or by the
                                        locality wherein the toll facility is located, or a facsimile of such a
                                        certificate, based on inspection of photographs, microphotographs, videotapes,
                                        or other recorded images produced by a photo-monitoring system, or of electronic
                                        data collected by an automatic vehicle identification system, shall be prima
                                        facie evidence of the facts contained therein. Any photographs,
                                        microphotographs, videotape, or other recorded images or electronic data
                                        evidencing such a violation shall be available for inspection in any proceeding
                                        to adjudicate the liability for such violation under this section. A record of
                                        communication by an automatic vehicle identification device with the automatic
                                        vehicle identification system at the time of a violation of this section shall
                                        be prima facie evidence that the automatic vehicle identification device was
                                        located in the vehicle registered to use such device in the records of the
                                        Department of Transportation.</p>
                                    <p>I. On a form prescribed by the Supreme Court, a summons for a violation of this
                                        section may be executed as provided in ยง <a

                                        section may set forth multiple violations occurring within one jurisdiction.
                                        Notwithstanding the provisions of ยง <a href='/vacode/19.2-76/'>19.2-76</a>, a

                                        of the violation in an affidavit executed pursuant to this subsection, such
                                        named operator of the vehicle. Such summons shall be signed either originally or
                                        by electronic signature. If the summoned person fails to appear on the date of
                                        return set out in the summons mailed pursuant to this section, the summons shall
                                        be executed in the manner set out in ยง <a
                                            href='/vacode/19.2-76.3/'>19.2-76.3</a>.</p>
                                    <p>Upon a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that the vehicle described in
                                        the summons issued pursuant to this subsection was in violation of this section,
                                        the court shall impose a civil penalty upon the owner or operator of such
                                        vehicle in accordance with the amounts specified in subsection D, together with
                                        applicable court costs, the operator's administrative fee, and the toll due.
                                        Penalties assessed as the result of action initiated by the Department of
                                        Transportation shall be remanded by the clerk of the court that adjudicated the
                                        action to the Department of Transportation's Toll Facilities Revolving Account.
                                        Penalties assessed as the result of action initiated by an operator of a toll
                                        facility other than the Department of Transportation shall be remanded by the
                                        clerk of the court that adjudicated the action to the treasurer or director of
                                        finance of the county or city in which the violation occurred for payment to the
                                        toll facility operator.</p>
                                    <p>The owner of such vehicle shall be given reasonable notice by way of a summons as
                                        provided in this subsection that his vehicle had been used in violation of this
                                        section, and such owner shall be given notice of the time and place of the
                                        hearing as well as the civil penalty and costs for such offense. The toll
                                        facility operator may offer to the owner an option to pay the unpaid toll and
                                        fees plus a reduced civil penalty of $25 for a first or second offense or $50

                                    penalty.</b>
                                <section class='body'>
                                    <p>A. For purposes of this section:</p>
                                    <p>"Debt collection" means the collection of unpaid tolls and applicable
                                        administrative fees by (i) retention of a third-party debt collector or (ii)
                                        collection practices undertaken by employees of a toll facility operator that
                                        are materially similar to a third-party debt collector.</p>
                                    <p>"Operator of a toll facility other than the Department of Transportation" means
                                        any agency, political subdivision, authority, or other entity that operates a
                                        toll facility.</p>
                                    <p>"Owner" means the registered owner of a vehicle on record with the Department of
                                        Motor Vehicles or with the equivalent agency in another state. "Owner" does not
                                        include a vehicle rental or vehicle leasing company.</p>
                                    <p>B. The toll facility operator may impose and collect an administrative fee in
                                        addition to the unpaid toll so as to recover the expenses of collecting the
                                        unpaid toll, which administrative fee shall be reasonably related to the actual
                                        cost of collecting the unpaid toll and not exceed $100 per violation. Such fee
                                        shall not be levied on a first unpaid toll unless the written promise to pay
                                        executed pursuant to subsection F remains unpaid after 30 days. The person who
                                        executed the written promise to pay pursuant to subsection F shall pay the
                                        unpaid toll and any administrative fee detailed in an invoice or bill issued by
                                        a toll facility operator. If paid within 60 days of notification, the
                                        administrative fee shall not exceed $25.</p>
                                    <p>C. If the matter proceeds to court, the owner or operator of the vehicle shall be
                                        liable for a civil penalty as follows: for a first offense, $50; for a second
                                        offense within one year from the first offense, $100; for a third offense within
                                        two years from the second offense, $250; and for a fourth and any subsequent
                                        offense within three years from the second offense, $500 plus, in each case, the
                                        unpaid toll, all accrued administrative fees imposed by the toll facility
                                        operator and applicable court costs if the vehicle operator is found, as
                                        evidenced by information obtained from the toll facility operator, to have used
                                        such a toll facility without payment of the required toll.</p>
                                    <p>D. Notwithstanding subsections B and C, for a first conviction of an operator or
                                        owner of a vehicle under this section, the total amount for the first conviction
                                        shall not exceed $2,200, including civil penalties and administrative fees
                                        regardless of the total number of offenses the operator or owner of a vehicle is
                                        convicted of on that date.</p>
                                    <p>E. No summons may be issued by a toll facility operator for a violation of this
                                        section unless the toll facility operator can demonstrate that (i) there was an
                                        attempt to collect the unpaid tolls and applicable administrative fees through
                                        debt collection not less than 30 days prior to issuance of the summons and (ii)
                                        120 days have elapsed since the unpaid toll or, in a summons for multiple
                                        violations, 120 days have elapsed since the most recent unpaid toll noticed on
                                        the summons.</p>
                                    <p>F. A written promise to pay an unpaid toll within a specified period of time
                                        executed by the operator of a motor vehicle, accompanied by a certificate sworn
                                        to or affirmed by an authorized agent of the toll facility that the unpaid toll
                                        was not paid within such specified period, shall be prima facie evidence of the
                                        facts contained therein.</p>
                                    <p>G. The operator of a toll facility shall send an invoice or bill to the owner of
                                        a motor vehicle using a toll facility without payment of the specified toll as
                                        part of an electronic or manual toll collection process pursuant to ยง <a
                                            href='/vacode/46.2-819.6/'>46.2-819.6</a>, prior to seeking remedies under
                                        this section. Any action under this section shall be brought in the general
                                        district court of the county or city in which the toll facility is located and
                                        shall be commenced within two years of the commission of the offense. Such an
                                        action shall be considered a traffic infraction. The attorney for the
                                        Commonwealth may represent the interests of the toll facility operator. Any
                                        authorized agent or employee of a toll facility operator acting on behalf of a
                                        governmental entity shall be allowed the privileges accorded by ยง <a
                                            href='/vacode/16.1-88.03/'>16.1-88.03</a> in such cases.</p>
                                    <p>H. Upon a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that the operator of a
                                        motor vehicle identified in the summons issued pursuant to subsection J was in
                                        violation of this section, the court shall impose a civil penalty upon the
                                        operator of a motor vehicle in accordance with the amounts specified in
                                        subsection C, together with applicable court costs, the operator's
                                        administrative fee, and the toll due. Penalties assessed as the result of action
                                        initiated by the Department of Transportation shall be remanded by the clerk of
                                        the court that adjudicated the action to the Department of Transportation's Toll
                                        Facilities Revolving Account. Penalties assessed as the result of action
                                        initiated by an operator of a toll facility other than the Department of
                                        Transportation shall be remanded by the clerk of the court that adjudicated the
                                        action to the treasurer or director of finance of the county or city in which
                                        the violation occurred for payment to the toll facility operator.</p>
                                    <p>I. The toll facility operator may offer to the owner an option to pay the unpaid
                                        toll and fees plus a reduced civil penalty of not more than $25 for a first or
                                        second offense or not more than $50 for a third, fourth, or subsequent offense,
                                        as specified on the summons, provided the owner actually pays to the toll
                                        facility operator the entire amount so calculated at least 14 days prior to the
                                        hearing date specified on the summons. If the owner accepts such offer and such
                                        amount is actually received by the toll facility operator at least 14 days prior
                                        to the hearing date specified on the summons, the toll facility operator shall
                                        move the court at least five business days prior to the date set for trial to
                                        dismiss the summons issued to the owner of the vehicle, and the court shall
                                        dismiss upon such motion.</p>
                                    <p>J. A summons for a violation of this section may be executed as provided in ยง <a

                                        section may set forth multiple violations occurring within one jurisdiction.
                                        Notwithstanding the provisions of ยง <a href='/vacode/19.2-76/'>19.2-76</a>, a

                                        vehicle as shown on the written promise to pay executed pursuant to subsection F
                                        or records of the Department of Motor Vehicles. Such summons shall be signed

                                        appear on the date of return set out in the summons mailed pursuant to this
                                        subsection, the summons shall be executed in the manner set out in ยง <a

                                    <p>K. Upon a finding by a court that a person has three or more unpaid tolls and
                                        such person fails to pay the required penalties, fees, and unpaid tolls, the
                                        court shall notify the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles, who
                                        shall refuse to issue or renew any vehicle registration certificate of any
                                        applicant or the license plate issued for any vehicle owned or co-owned by the
                                        offender or, when the vehicle is registered in a state with which the
                                        Commonwealth has entered into an agreement to enforce tolling violations
                                        pursuant to ยง <a href='/vacode/46.2-819.9/'>46.2-819.9</a>, who shall provide to

                                        plates in the state in which the vehicle is registered sufficient evidence of
                                        the court's finding to take action against the vehicle registration certificate
                                        or license plates in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Upon receipt of

                                        Vehicles shall notify the state where the vehicle is registered of such payment.
                                        The Commissioner shall collect a $40 administrative fee from the owner or
                                        operator of the vehicle to defray the cost of processing and removing an order
                                        to deny registration or registration renewal.</p>
                                    <p>L. Imposition of a civil penalty pursuant to this section shall not be deemed a
                                        conviction as an operator and shall not be made part of the driving record of

                                    <p>M. No person shall be subject to both the provisions of this section and to

                                    <p>A. For purposes of this section:</p>
                                    <p>"Automatic vehicle identification device" means an electronic device that
                                        communicates by wireless transmission with an automatic vehicle identification
                                        system.</p>
                                    <p>"Automatic vehicle identification system" means an electronic vehicle
                                        identification system installed to work in conjunction with a toll collection
                                        device that automatically produces an electronic record of each vehicle equipped
                                        with an automatic vehicle identification device that uses a toll facility.</p>
                                    <p>"Debt collection" means the collection of unpaid tolls and applicable
                                        administrative fees by (i) retention of a third-party debt collector or (ii)
                                        collection practices undertaken by employees of a toll facility operator that
                                        are materially similar to a third-party debt collector.</p>
                                    <p>"Operator" means a person who was driving a vehicle that was the subject of a
                                        toll violation but who is not the owner of the vehicle.</p>
                                    <p>"Operator of a toll facility other than the Department of Transportation" means
                                        any agency, political subdivision, authority, or other entity that operates a

                                        Motor Vehicles or with the equivalent agency in another state. "Owner" does not
                                        mean a vehicle rental or vehicle leasing company that meets the requirements for
                                        such companies set forth in this section.</p>
                                    <p>"Video-monitoring system" means a vehicle sensor installed to work in conjunction
                                        with a toll collection device that automatically produces one or more

                                    <p>B. The operator of any toll facility or the locality within which such toll
                                        facility is located may install and operate or cause to be installed and
                                        operated a video-monitoring system in conjunction with an automatic vehicle
                                        identification system on facilities for which tolls are collected for the use of
                                        such toll facility and that do not offer manual toll collection. A
                                        video-monitoring system shall include, but not be limited to, electronic systems
                                        that monitor and capture images of vehicles using a toll facility to enable toll
                                        collection for vehicles that do not pay using a toll collection device. The
                                        operator of a toll facility shall send an invoice for unpaid tolls in accordance
                                        with the requirements of ยง <a href='/vacode/46.2-819.6/'>46.2-819.6</a> to the
                                        owner of a vehicle as part of a video-monitoring toll collection process, prior
                                        to seeking remedies under this section.</p>
                                    <p>C. Information collected by a video-monitoring system in conjunction with an

                                        subsection B shall be limited exclusively to that information that is necessary
                                        for the collection of unpaid tolls and establishing when violations occur,
                                        including use in any proceeding to determine whether a violation occurred.
                                        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all images or other data collected
                                        by a video-monitoring system in conjunction with an automatic vehicle
                                        identification system shall be protected in a database with security comparable

                                        collection of unpaid tolls and for efforts to pursue violators of this section
                                        and shall not (i) be open to the public; (ii) be sold and/or used for sales,
                                        solicitation, or marketing purposes other than those of the toll facility
                                        operator to facilitate toll payment; (iii) be disclosed to any other entity
                                        except as may be necessary for the collection of unpaid tolls or to a vehicle
                                        owner or operator as part of a challenge to the imposition of a toll; and/or
                                        (iv) be used in a court in a pending action or proceeding unless the action or
                                        proceeding relates to a violation of this section or upon order from a court of
                                        competent jurisdiction. Except as provided above, information collected under
                                        this section shall be purged and not retained later than 30 days after the
                                        collection and reconciliation of any unpaid tolls, administrative fees, and/or
                                        civil penalties. Any entity operating a video-monitoring system in conjunction
                                        with an automatic vehicle identification system shall annually certify
                                        compliance with this section and make all records pertaining to such system
                                        available for inspection and audit by the Commissioner of Highways or the
                                        Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles or their designee. Any
                                        violation of this subsection shall constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor. In addition
                                        to any fines or other penalties provided for by law, any money or other thing of
                                        value obtained as a result of a violation of this section shall be forfeited to
                                        the Commonwealth.</p>
                                    <p>If a vehicle uses a toll facility without paying the toll, the owner or operator
                                        shall be in violation of this section if he refuses to pay the toll within 30
                                        days of notification. The toll facility operator may impose and collect an
                                        administrative fee in addition to the unpaid toll so as to recover the expenses
                                        of collecting the unpaid toll, which administrative fee shall be reasonably
                                        related to the actual cost of collecting the unpaid toll and not exceed $100 per
                                        violation. Such fee shall not be levied upon the owner or operator of the
                                        vehicle unless the toll has not been paid by the owner or operator within 30
                                        days after receipt of the invoice for the unpaid toll, which nonpayment for 30
                                        days shall constitute the violation of this section. Once such a violation has
                                        occurred, the owner or operator of the vehicle shall pay the unpaid tolls and
                                        any administrative fee detailed in the invoice for the unpaid toll issued by a
                                        toll facility operator. If paid within 60 days of the toll violation, the
                                        administrative fee shall not exceed $25.</p>
                                    <p>The toll facility operator may levy charges for the direct cost of use of and
                                        processing for a video-monitoring system and to cover the cost of the invoice,
                                        which are in addition to the toll and may not exceed double the amount of the
                                        base toll, provided that potential toll facility users are provided notice
                                        before entering the facility by conspicuous signs that clearly indicate that the
                                        toll for use of the facility could be tripled for any vehicle that does not have
                                        an active, functioning automatic vehicle identification device registered for
                                        and in use in the vehicle using the toll facility, and such signs are posted at
                                        a location where the operator can still choose to avoid the use of the toll
                                        facility if he chooses not to pay the toll.</p>
                                    <p>A person receiving an invoice for an unpaid toll under this section may (a) pay
                                        the toll and administrative fees directly to the toll facility operator or (b)
                                        file with the toll facility operator a notice, on a form provided by the toll
                                        facility operator as required under subsection B of ยง <a

                                        violation. The notice to contest liability for a toll violation may be filed by
                                        any person receiving an invoice for an unpaid toll by mailing or delivering the
                                        notice to the toll facility operator within 60 days of receiving such invoice
                                        for an unpaid toll. Upon receipt of such notice, the toll facility operator may
                                        issue a summons pursuant to subsection I and may not seek withholding of
                                        registration or renewal thereof under subsection L until a court of competent
                                        jurisdiction has found the alleged violator liable for tolls under this section.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>D. If the matter proceeds to court, the owner or operator of a vehicle shall be
                                        liable for a civil penalty as follows: for a first offense, $50; for a second
                                        offense within one year from the first offense, $100; for a third offense within
                                        two years from the second offense, $250; and for a fourth and any subsequent
                                        offense within three years from the second offense, $500; plus, in each case,
                                        the unpaid toll, all accrued administrative fees imposed by the toll facility
                                        operator, and applicable court costs if the vehicle is found, as evidenced by
                                        information obtained from a video-monitoring system in conjunction with an
                                        automatic vehicle identification system as provided in this section, to have
                                        used such a toll facility without payment of the required toll within 30 days of
                                        receipt of the invoice for the toll.</p>
                                    <p>E. Notwithstanding subsections C and D, for a first conviction of an operator or
                                        owner of a vehicle under this section the total amount for the first conviction
                                        shall not exceed $2,200, including civil penalties and administrative fees
                                        regardless of the total number of offenses the operator or owner of a vehicle is
                                        convicted of on that date.</p>
                                    <p>F. No summons may be issued by a toll facility operator for a violation of this
                                        section unless the toll facility operator can demonstrate that (i) there was an
                                        attempt to collect the unpaid tolls and applicable administrative fees through
                                        debt collection not less than 30 days prior to issuance of the summons and (ii)
                                        120 days have elapsed since the unpaid toll or, in a summons for multiple
                                        violations, 120 days have elapsed since the most recent unpaid toll noticed on
                                        the summons.</p>
                                    <p>G. Any action under this section shall be brought in the general district court
                                        of the county or city in which the toll facility is located and shall be
                                        commenced within two years of the commission of the offense. Such action shall
                                        be considered a traffic infraction. The attorney for the Commonwealth may
                                        represent the interests of the toll facility operator. Any authorized agent or
                                        employee of a toll facility operator acting on behalf of a governmental entity
                                        shall be allowed the privileges accorded by ยง <a

                                    <p>H. Proof of a violation of this section shall be evidenced by information
                                        obtained from a video-monitoring system or automatic vehicle identification

                                        data collected by an automatic vehicle identification system, shall be prima
                                        facie evidence of the facts contained therein. Any photographs,
                                        microphotographs, videotape, or other recorded images or electronic data
                                        evidencing such a violation shall be available for inspection in any proceeding
                                        to adjudicate the liability for such violation under this section. A record of
                                        communication by an automatic vehicle identification device with the automatic
                                        vehicle identification system at the time of a violation of this section shall
                                        be prima facie evidence that the automatic vehicle identification device was
                                        located in the vehicle registered to use such device in the records of the

                                    <p>I. On a form prescribed by the Supreme Court, a summons for a violation of this
                                        section may be executed as provided in ยง <a

                                        section may set forth multiple violations occurring within one jurisdiction.
                                        Notwithstanding the provisions of ยง <a href='/vacode/19.2-76/'>19.2-76</a>, a

                                    <p>J. Upon a finding by a court of competent jurisdiction that the vehicle described
                                        in the summons issued pursuant to subsection I was in violation of this section,
                                        the court shall impose a civil penalty upon the owner or operator of such
                                        vehicle in accordance with the amounts specified in subsection D, together with
                                        applicable court costs, the operator's administrative fee, and the toll due.
                                        Penalties assessed as the result of action initiated by the Department of

                                        Penalties assessed as the result of action initiated by an operator of a toll
                                        facility other than the Department of Transportation shall be remanded by the
                                        clerk of the court that adjudicated the action to the treasurer or director of
                                        finance of the county or city in which the violation occurred for payment to the

                                    <p>The owner of such vehicle shall be given reasonable notice by way of a summons as
                                        provided in subsection I that his vehicle had been used in violation of this
                                        section, and such owner shall be given notice of the time and place of the

                                    <p>It shall be prima facie evidence that the vehicle described in the summons issued
                                        pursuant to subsection I was operated in violation of this section. Records
                                        obtained from the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to subsection P and

                                        shall give rise to a rebuttable presumption that the owner of the vehicle is the
                                        person named in the summons.</p>
                                    <p>Upon the filing of an affidavit by the owner of the vehicle with the toll
                                        facility operator within 14 days of receipt of an invoice for unpaid toll or a

                                        of the violation and providing the legal name and address of the operator of the

                                        whichever the case may be, will also be issued to the alleged operator of the

                                    <p>In any action against a vehicle operator, an affidavit made by the owner
                                        providing the name and address of the vehicle operator at the time of the
                                        violation shall constitute prima facie evidence that the person named in the

                                        matter named in the affidavit.</p>
                                    <p>If the owner of the vehicle produces for the toll facility operator or the court

                                        stolen at the time of the alleged offense, then the toll facility operator shall
                                        not pursue the owner for the unpaid toll contained in the invoice for unpaid
                                        toll or the court shall dismiss the summons issued to the owner of the vehicle.

                                        registered of such payment. Such funds representing payment of unpaid tolls and
                                        all administrative fees of the toll facility operator shall be transferred from

                                        registration renewal, and the toll facility operator may add this fee to the

                                        operator within 21 days after the date of mailing of the Commissioner's notice.
                                        Upon timely receipt of the form, the toll facility operator shall notify the

                                    <p>M. Any vehicle rental or vehicle leasing company, if it receives an invoice for
                                        unpaid toll or is named in a summons, shall be released as a party to the action
                                        if it provides the operator of the toll facility a copy of the vehicle rental
                                        agreement or lease or an affidavit identifying the renter or lessee within 30
                                        days of receipt of the invoice or summons. Upon receipt of such rental
                                        agreement, lease, or affidavit, an invoice for unpaid toll shall be mailed to
                                        the renter or lessee identified therein. Release of this information shall not
                                        be deemed a violation of any provision of the Government Data Collection and
                                        Dissemination Practices Act (ยง <a href='/vacode/2.2-3800/'>2.2-3800</a> et seq.)

                                        shall allow at least 30 days from the date of such mailing before pursuing other
                                        remedies under this section. In any action against the vehicle operator, a copy
                                        of the vehicle rental agreement, lease, or affidavit identifying the renter or
                                        lessee of the vehicle at the time of the violation is prima facie evidence that
                                        the person named in the rental agreement, lease, or affidavit was operating the
                                        vehicle at all the relevant times relating to the matter named in the summons.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>N. Imposition of a civil penalty pursuant to this section shall not be deemed a
                                        conviction as an operator and shall not be made part of the driving record of
                                        the person upon whom such civil penalty is imposed, nor shall it be used for

                                    <p>O. The toll facility operator may offer to the owner an option to pay the unpaid
                                        toll and fees plus a reduced civil penalty of $25 for a first or second offense
                                        or $50 for a third, fourth, or subsequent offense, as specified on the summons,
                                        provided the owner actually pays to the toll facility operator the entire amount
                                        so calculated at least 14 days prior to the hearing date specified on the
                                        summons. If the owner accepts such offer and such amount is actually received by
                                        the toll facility operator at least 14 days prior to the hearing date specified
                                        on the summons, the toll facility operator shall move the court at least five
                                        business days prior to the date set for trial to dismiss the summons issued to
                                        the owner of the vehicle, and the court shall dismiss upon such motion.</p>
                                    <p>P. The operator of a toll facility may enter into an agreement with the

                                        the applicable civil penalty and of any administrative fee calculated in
                                        accordance with subsection C to the registered owner of the vehicle identified
                                        by the system prior to seeking further remedies under this section. Upon receipt
                                        of the notice, the registered owner of the vehicle may elect to avoid any action
                                        by the operator to enforce the violation in court by waiving his right to a
                                        court hearing, pleading guilty to the violation, and paying a reduced civil
                                        penalty along with any applicable administrative fee to the operator. Should the
                                        recipient of the notice make such an election, the amount of the reduced civil
                                        penalty shall be as follows: $30 for the first violation; $50 for a second
                                        violation within one year from the first violation; $125 for a third violation
                                        within two years from the second violation; and $250 for a fourth and any
                                        subsequent violations within three years from the second violation.</p>
                                    <p>B. Information collected by the photo-monitoring system or automatic vehicle
                                        identification system referenced in subsection A shall be limited exclusively to
                                        that information that is necessary for identifying those drivers who improperly
                                        use the Dulles Access Highway in violation of the Authority regulation.
                                        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all photographs, microphotographs,
                                        electronic images, or other data collected by a photo-monitoring system or
                                        automatic vehicle identification system shall be used exclusively for the
                                        identification of violators and shall not (i) be open to the public; (ii) be
                                        sold or used for sales, solicitation, or marketing purposes; (iii) be disclosed
                                        to any other entity except as may be necessary for the identification of
                                        violators or to a vehicle owner or operator as part of a challenge to the
                                        imposition of a civil penalty; or (iv) be used in a court in a pending action or
                                        proceeding unless the action or proceeding relates to a violation of the
                                        Authority regulation governing usage of the Dulles Access Highway or upon order
                                        from a court of competent jurisdiction. Information collected by the system
                                        shall be protected in a database with security comparable to that of the
                                        Department of Motor Vehicles' system, and be purged and not retained later than
                                        30 days after the collection and reconciliation of any civil penalties and
                                        administrative fees. The operator of the Dulles Access Highway shall annually
                                        certify compliance with this subsection and make all records pertaining to such
                                        system available for inspection and audit by the Commissioner of Highways or the
                                        Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles or their designee. Any
                                        violation of this subsection shall constitute a Class 1 misdemeanor. In addition
                                        to any fines or other penalties provided for by law, any money or other thing of
                                        value obtained as a result of a violation of this subsection shall be forfeited
                                        to the Commonwealth.</p>
                                    <p>C. The operator of the Dulles Access Highway may impose and collect an
                                        administrative fee, in addition to the civil penalty established by regulation,
                                        so as to recover the expenses of collecting the civil penalty, which
                                        administrative fee shall be reasonably related to the actual cost of collecting
                                        the civil penalty and shall not exceed $100 per violation. Such fee shall not be
                                        levied upon the operator of the vehicle until a second violation has been
                                        documented within 12 months of an initial violation, in which case the fee shall
                                        apply to such second violation and to any additional violation occurring
                                        thereafter. If the recipient of the notice referenced in subsection A makes the
                                        election provided by that subsection, the administrative fee shall not exceed
                                        $25.</p>
                                    <p>D. If the election provided for in subsection A is not made, the operator of the
                                        Dulles Access Highway may proceed to enforce the violation in court. If the
                                        matter proceeds to court, the registered owner or operator of a vehicle shall be
                                        liable for the civil penalty set out in the Authority regulation governing usage
                                        of the Dulles Access Highway, any applicable administrative fees calculated in
                                        accordance with subsection C and applicable court costs if the vehicle is found,
                                        as evidenced by information obtained from a photo-monitoring system or automatic
                                        vehicle identification system as provided in this section, to have used the
                                        Dulles Access Highway in violation of the Authority regulation; provided, that
                                        the civil penalty may not exceed the amount of the penalty identified in
                                        subsection A.</p>
                                    <p>E. Any action under this section shall be brought in the General District Court
                                        of the county in which the violation occurred.</p>
                                    <p>F. Proof of a violation of the Authority regulation governing the use of the
                                        Dulles Access Highway shall be evidenced by information obtained from the
                                        photo-monitoring system or automatic vehicle identification system referenced in
                                        subsection A. A certificate, sworn to or affirmed by a technician employed or
                                        authorized by the operator of the Dulles Access Highway, or a facsimile of such
                                        a certificate, that is based on inspection of photographs, microphotographs,
                                        videotapes, or other recorded images or electronic data produced by the
                                        photo-monitoring system shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained
                                        therein. Any photographs, microphotographs, videotape, or other recorded images
                                        or electronic data evidencing such a violation shall be available for inspection
                                        in any proceeding to adjudicate the liability for such violation under this
                                        section.</p>
                                    <p>G. A summons issued under this section, which describes a vehicle that, on the
                                        basis of a certificate referenced in subsection F, is alleged to have been

                                        Access Highway, shall be prima facie evidence that such vehicle was operated in
                                        violation of the Authority regulation.</p>
                                    <p>H. Upon a finding by a court that the vehicle described in the summons issued
                                        under this section was in violation of the Authority regulation, the court shall
                                        impose a civil penalty upon the registered owner or operator of such vehicle in
                                        accordance with the penalty amounts specified in subsection D, together with any
                                        applicable court costs and applicable administrative fees calculated in
                                        accordance with subsection C. Civil penalties and administrative fees assessed
                                        as a result of an action initiated under this section and collected by the court
                                        shall be remanded by the clerk of the court that adjudicated the action to the
                                        treasurer or director of finance of the county or city in which the violation
                                        occurred for payment to the operator of the Dulles Access Highway.</p>
                                    <p>The registered owner of a vehicle shall be given reasonable notice of an
                                        enforcement action in court by way of a summons that informs the owner that his
                                        vehicle has been used in violation of the Authority regulation governing the use
                                        of the Dulles Access Highway and of the time and place of the court hearing, as

                                        vehicle on the date of the violation and providing the legal name and address of
                                        the operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation, a summons shall be
                                        issued to such alleged operator of the vehicle.</p>
                                    <p>In any action against such a vehicle operator, an affidavit made by the
                                        registered owner providing the name and address of the vehicle operator at the
                                        time of the violation shall constitute prima facie evidence that the person
                                        named in the affidavit was operating the vehicle at all the relevant times
                                        relating to the matter addressed in the affidavit.</p>
                                    <p>If the registered owner of the vehicle produces a certified copy of a police
                                        report showing that the vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior
                                        to the time of the alleged offense and remained stolen at the time of the
                                        alleged offense, then the court shall dismiss the summons issued to the
                                        registered owner of the vehicle.</p>
                                    <p>I. Upon a finding by a court that a person has three or more violations of the

                                        into the court, the court shall notify the Commissioner of the Department of

                                        such person until the court has notified the Commissioner that such civil
                                        penalties, fees, and costs have been paid. The Commissioner shall collect a $40
                                        administrative fee from such person to defray the cost of responding to court
                                        notices given pursuant to this subsection.</p>

                                        rebuttable presumption that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person
                                        who operated the vehicle at the place where, and for the time during which, the

                                        facie evidence that the bus was stopped for the purpose of taking on or

                                    <p>B. 1. For purposes of this section, "video-monitoring system" means a system with
                                        one or more camera sensors and computers installed and operated on a school bus
                                        that produces live digital and recorded video of motor vehicles being operated
                                        in violation of ยง <a href='/vacode/46.2-859/'>46.2-859</a>. All such systems
                                        installed shall, at a minimum, produce a recorded image of the license plate and
                                        shall record the activation status of at least one warning device as prescribed
                                        in ยง <a href='/vacode/46.2-1090/'>46.2-1090</a> and the time, date, and location
                                        of the vehicle when the image is recorded.</p>
                                    <p>2. A locality may, by ordinance, authorize the school division of the locality to
                                        install and operate a video-monitoring system in or on the school buses operated
                                        by the division or to contract with a private vendor to do so on behalf of the
                                        school division for the purpose of recording violations of subsection A. Such
                                        ordinance may direct that any civil penalty levied for a violation of subsection
                                        A shall be payable to the local school division. In any locality that has
                                        adopted such an ordinance, a summons for a violation of subsection A may be
                                        executed as provided in ยง <a href='/vacode/19.2-76.2/'>19.2-76.2</a> and,
                                        notwithstanding the provisions of ยง <a href='/vacode/19.2-76/'>19.2-76</a>, the
                                        summons may be executed by mailing by first-class mail a copy thereof to the
                                        address of the owner of the vehicle contained in the records of the Department.
                                        Every such mailing shall include, in addition to the summons, a notice of (i)
                                        the summoned person's ability to rebut the presumption that he was the operator
                                        of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation through the filing of an
                                        affidavit as provided in subsection A and (ii) instructions for filing such an
                                        affidavit, including the address to which the affidavit is to be sent. If the
                                        summoned person fails to appear on the date of return set out in the summons
                                        mailed pursuant to this section, the summons shall be executed in the manner set
                                        out in ยง <a href='/vacode/19.2-76.3/'>19.2-76.3</a>. No proceedings for contempt
                                        or arrest of a person summoned by mailing shall be instituted for failure to
                                        appear on the return date of the summons. Any summons executed for violation of
                                        this section shall provide to the person summoned at least 30 business days from
                                        the mailing of the summons to inspect information collected by a
                                        video-monitoring system in connection with the violation.</p>
                                    <p>3. Any private vendor contracting with a school division pursuant to this
                                        subsection may impose and collect an administrative fee in addition to the civil
                                        penalty imposed for a violation of subsection A and payable pursuant to this
                                        subsection, so as to recover the expenses of collecting any unpaid civil penalty
                                        when such penalty remains due more than 30 days after the date of the mailing of
                                        the summons and notice. The administrative fee shall be reasonably related to
                                        the actual cost of collecting the civil penalty and shall not exceed $100 per
                                        violation. The operator of the vehicle shall pay the unpaid civil penalty and
                                        any administrative fee detailed in a notice or citation issued by the private
                                        vendor. If paid no later than 60 days after the date of the mailing of the
                                        summons and notice, the administrative fee shall not exceed $25. No contract
                                        entered into pursuant to this subsection shall require a minimum quota of
                                        violations captured or citations issued in order for the video-monitoring system
                                        to be deployed.</p>
                                    <p>4. Any private vendor contracting with a school division pursuant to this
                                        subsection may enter into an agreement with the Department of Motor Vehicles, in
                                        accordance with the provisions of subdivision B 30 of ยง <a
                                            href='/vacode/46.2-208/'>46.2-208</a>, to obtain vehicle owner information
                                        regarding the registered owners of vehicles that improperly pass stopped school
                                        buses. Information provided to such private vendor shall be protected in a
                                        database with security comparable to that of the Department of Motor Vehicles'
                                        system and used only for enforcement against individuals who violate the
                                        provisions of this section. The school division shall annually certify

                                        available for inspection and audit by the Commissioner of Highways or the
                                        Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles or their designee. Any person

                                        subdivision shall be subject to a civil penalty of $1,000 per disclosure. Any

                                    <p>A. Except where turning is prohibited, a driver intending to turn at an
                                        intersection or other location on any highway shall execute the turn as provided
                                        in this section.</p>
                                    <p>1. Right turns: Both the approach for a right turn and a right turn shall be made

                                        approach for a left turn shall be made from the right half of the roadway and as
                                        close as possible to the roadway's center line, passing to the right of the
                                        center line where it enters the intersection. After entering the intersection,
                                        the left turn shall be made so as to leave the intersection to the right of the
                                        center line of the roadway being entered. Whenever practicable, the left turn
                                        shall be made to the left of the center of the intersection.</p>
                                    <p>3. Left turns on other than two-way roadways: At any intersection where traffic

                                        crossover from one roadway of a divided highway to another roadway thereof on
                                        which traffic moves in the opposite direction, the driver intending to turn left
                                        at any such intersection or crossover shall approach the intersection or
                                        crossover in the extreme left lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the
                                        direction of travel of such vehicle and after entering the intersection or
                                        crossover the left turn shall be made so as to leave the intersection or
                                        crossover, as nearly as practicable, in the left lane lawfully available to
                                        traffic moving in such direction upon the roadway being entered.</p>
                                    <p>B. Local authorities having the power to regulate traffic in their respective
                                        jurisdictions may cause traffic control devices to be placed within or adjacent

                                        in this section be traveled by vehicles turning at any intersection. When

                                    <p>A. For the purposes of this section, "school crossing zone" means an area located
                                        within the vicinity of a school at or near a highway where the presence of
                                        children on such school property or going to and from school reasonably requires
                                        a special warning to motorists. Such zones are marked and operated in accordance
                                        with the requirements of this section with appropriate warning signs or other
                                        traffic control devices indicating that a school crossing is in progress.</p>
                                    <p>B. The maximum speed limit shall be 25 miles per hour between portable signs,
                                        tilt-over signs, or fixed blinking signs placed in or along any highway and
                                        bearing the word "school" or "school crossing." Any signs erected under this
                                        section shall be placed not more than 750 feet from the limits of the school
                                        property or crossing in the vicinity of the school. However, "school crossing"
                                        signs may be placed in any location if the Department of Transportation or the
                                        council of the city or town or the board of supervisors of a county maintaining
                                        its own system of secondary roads approves the crossing for such signs. If the
                                        portion of the highway to be posted is within the limits of a city or town, such
                                        portable signs shall be furnished and delivered by such city or town. If the
                                        portion of highway to be posted is outside the limits of a city or town, such
                                        portable signs shall be furnished and delivered by the Department of
                                        Transportation. The principal or chief administrative officer of each school or
                                        a school board designee, preferably not a classroom teacher, shall place such
                                        portable signs in the highway at a point not more than 750 feet from the limits
                                        of the school property and remove such signs when their presence is no longer
                                        required by this section. Such portable signs, tilt-over signs, or fixed
                                        blinking signs shall be placed in a position plainly visible to vehicular
                                        traffic approaching from either direction, but shall not be placed so as to
                                        obstruct the roadway.</p>
                                    <p>C. Such portable signs, tilt-over signs, or blinking signs shall be in a
                                        position, or be turned on, for 30 minutes preceding regular school hours, for 30
                                        minutes thereafter, and during such other times as the presence of children on
                                        such school property or going to and from school reasonably requires a special
                                        warning to motorists. The governing body of any county, city, or town may,
                                        however, decrease the period of time preceding and following regular school
                                        hours during which such portable signs, tilt-over signs, or blinking signs shall
                                        be in position or lit if it determines that no children will be going to or from
                                        school during the period of time that it subtracts from the 30-minute period.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>D. The governing body of any city or town may, if the portion of the highway to
                                        be posted is within the limits of such city or town, increase or decrease the
                                        speed limit provided in this section only after justification for such increase
                                        or decrease has been shown by an engineering and traffic investigation, and no
                                        such increase or decrease in speed limit shall be effective unless such
                                        increased or decreased speed limit is conspicuously posted on the portable
                                        signs, tilt-over signs, or fixed blinking signs required by this section.</p>
                                    <p>E. The governing body of a county within Planning District 8 may, if the portion
                                        of the highway to be posted is within the limits of such county, increase or
                                        decrease the speed limit provided in this section only after justification for
                                        such increase or decrease has been shown by an engineering and traffic
                                        investigation, and no such increase or decrease in speed limit shall be
                                        effective unless such increased or decreased speed limit is conspicuously posted
                                        on the portable signs, tilt-over signs, or fixed blinking signs required by this
                                        section.</p>
                                    <p>F. The City of Virginia Beach may establish school zones as provided in this
                                        section and mark such zones with flashing warning lights as provided in this
                                        section on and along all highways adjacent to Route 58.</p>
                                    <p>G. Any person operating any motor vehicle in excess of a maximum speed limit
                                        established specifically for a school crossing zone when such school crossing
                                        zone is (i) indicated by appropriately placed signs displaying the maximum speed
                                        limit and (ii) in operation pursuant to subsection B shall be guilty of a
                                        traffic infraction punishable by a fine of not more than $250, in addition to
                                        other penalties provided by law.</p>
                                    <p>H. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the maximum speed
                                        limit in school zones in residential areas may be decreased to 15 miles per hour
                                        if (i) the school board having jurisdiction over the school nearest to the
                                        affected school zone passes a resolution requesting the reduction of the maximum
                                        speed limit for such school zone from 25 miles per hour to 15 miles per hour and
                                        (ii) the local governing body of the jurisdiction in which such school is
                                        located enacts an ordinance establishing the speed-limit reduction requested by
                                        the school board.</p>

                                        established and posted as provided in this section. The increased or decreased

                                        shall be effective only when prescribed in writing by the Commissioner of
                                        Highways and kept on file in the Central Office of the Department of
                                        Transportation. Whenever the speed limit on any highway has been increased or

                                        limit to less than 25 miles per hour on any highway within its boundaries,
                                        provided such reduced speed limit is indicated by lawfully placed signs.</p>
                                    <p>C. If the Commissioner of Highways increases or decreases a speed limit as
                                        provided in this section, the Department of Transportation shall notify the
                                        primary liaison with the Department of Transportation in each locality in which
                                        such speed limit change will occur. If such speed limit change will occur in a
                                        town, the Department of Transportation shall notify the primary liaison in the

                                        shall include the location where the speed limit change will occur, the

                                        speed limit change. Failure to comply with any provision of this subsection
                                        shall not affect the change in speed limit.</p>

                                    <p>A. For the purposes of this section:</p>
                                    <p>"High-risk intersection segment" means any highway or portion thereof located not
                                        more than 1,000 feet from the limits of the property of a school that is part of
                                        or adjacent to an intersection containing a marked crosswalk that is identified
                                        in the manner provided in this section as one in which a traffic fatality has
                                        occurred since January 1, 2014.</p>
                                    <p>"Highway work zone" has the same meaning ascribed to it in ยง <a

                                    <p>"Photo speed monitoring device" means equipment that uses radar or LIDAR-based
                                        speed detection and produces one or more photographs, microphotographs,
                                        videotapes, or other recorded images of vehicles.</p>
                                    <p>"School crossing zone" has the same meaning ascribed to it in ยง <a

                                    <p>"Vehicle speed violation" means a violation of this title resulting from the
                                        operation of a vehicle in excess of the speed limit, including a violation of ยง
                                        <a href='/vacode/46.2-873/'>46.2-873</a> or <a

                                    <p>B. A state or local law-enforcement agency may place and operate a photo speed
                                        monitoring device in school crossing zones for the purposes of recording
                                        violations of ยง <a href='/vacode/46.2-873/'>46.2-873</a> and in highway work
                                        zones for the purposes of recording violations of ยง <a

                                    <p>A state or local law-enforcement agency may place and operate a photo speed
                                        monitoring device at a high-risk intersection segment located within the
                                        locality for the purpose of recording vehicle speed violations, provided that
                                        such law-enforcement agency certifies that a traffic fatality has occurred since
                                        January 1, 2014, in such segment.</p>
                                    <p>C. The operator of a vehicle shall be liable for a monetary civil penalty imposed
                                        pursuant to this section if such vehicle is found, as evidenced by information
                                        obtained from a photo speed monitoring device, to be traveling at speeds of at
                                        least 10 miles per hour above the posted speed limit in the zone monitored by
                                        the photo speed monitoring device. Such civil penalty shall not exceed $100, and
                                        any prosecution shall be instituted and conducted in the same manner as
                                        prosecution for traffic infractions. Civil penalties collected under this
                                        section resulting from a summons issued by a local law-enforcement officer shall
                                        be paid to the locality in which such violation occurred. Civil penalties
                                        collected under this section resulting from a summons issued by a
                                        law-enforcement officer employed by the Department of State Police shall be paid
                                        into the Literary Fund. However, all civil penalties collected under this
                                        section resulting from a summons issued based on evidence obtained from a photo
                                        speed monitoring device placed and operated at a high-risk intersection segment
                                        shall be paid to the Commonwealth Transportation Board to be used for the
                                        Virginia Highway Safety Improvement Program established pursuant to ยง <a

                                    <p>D. If a photo speed monitoring device is used, proof of a vehicle speed violation
                                        shall be evidenced by information obtained from such device. A certificate, or a
                                        facsimile thereof, sworn to or affirmed by a law-enforcement officer, based upon
                                        inspection of photographs, microphotographs, videotapes, or other recorded
                                        images produced by a photo speed monitoring device, shall be prima facie
                                        evidence of the facts contained therein. Any photographs, microphotographs,
                                        videotapes, or other recorded images evidencing such a violation shall be
                                        available for inspection in any proceeding to adjudicate the liability for such
                                        vehicle speed violation.</p>
                                    <p>E. In the prosecution for a vehicle speed violation in which a summons was issued
                                        by mail, prima facie evidence that the vehicle described in the summons issued
                                        pursuant to this section was operated in a manner constituting a vehicle speed
                                        violation, together with proof that the defendant was at the time of such
                                        violation the owner, lessee, or renter of the vehicle, shall constitute in
                                        evidence a rebuttable presumption that such owner, lessee, or renter of the
                                        vehicle was the person who committed the violation. Such presumption shall be
                                        rebutted if the owner, lessee, or renter of the vehicle (i) files an affidavit
                                        by regular mail with the clerk of the general district court that he was not the
                                        operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation and provides the
                                        name and address of the person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the
                                        alleged violation or (ii) testifies in open court under oath that he was not the
                                        operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation and provides the
                                        name and address of the person who was operating the vehicle at the time of the
                                        alleged violation. Such presumption shall also be rebutted if a certified copy
                                        of a police report, showing that the vehicle had been reported to the police as
                                        stolen prior to the time of the alleged vehicle speed violation, is presented,
                                        prior to the return date established on the summons issued pursuant to this
                                        section, to the court adjudicating the alleged violation.</p>
                                    <p>F. Imposition of a penalty pursuant to this section by mailing a summons shall
                                        not be deemed a conviction as an operator and shall not be made part of the
                                        operating record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed, nor shall it
                                        be used for insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance
                                        coverage. However, if a law-enforcement officer uses a photo speed monitoring
                                        device to record a vehicle speed violation and personally issues a summons at
                                        the time of the violation, the conviction that results shall be made a part of
                                        such driver's driving record and used for insurance purposes in the provision of
                                        motor vehicle insurance coverage.</p>
                                    <p>G. A summons for a vehicle speed violation issued by mail pursuant to this
                                        section may be executed pursuant to ยง <a

                                        this section may be executed by mailing by first-class mail a copy thereof to
                                        the owner, lessee, or renter of the vehicle. In the case of a vehicle owner, the
                                        copy shall be mailed to the address contained in the records of or accessible to

                                <section class='body'>
                                    <p>A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, an electric power-assisted
                                        bicycle or an operator of an electric power-assisted bicycle shall be afforded
                                        all the rights and privileges, and be subject to all of the duties, of a bicycle
                                        or the operator of a bicycle. An electric power-assisted bicycle is a vehicle to
                                        the same extent as is a bicycle.</p>
                                    <p>B. An electric power-assisted bicycle or person operating an electric
                                        power-assisted bicycle is not subject to the provisions of this Code relating to
                                        requirements for driver's licenses, registration, certificates of title,
                                        financial responsibility, off-highway motorcycles, and license plates.</p>
                                    <p>C. 1. On and after January 1, 2021, manufacturers and distributors of electric
                                        power-assisted bicycles shall permanently affix a label, in a prominent
                                        location, to each electric power-assisted bicycle that they manufacture or
                                        distribute. The label shall contain the classification number, top assisted
                                        speed, and motor wattage of the electric power-assisted bicycle and shall be
                                        printed in Arial font in at least nine-point type.</p>
                                    <p>2. An electric power-assisted bicycle shall comply with equipment and
                                        manufacturing requirements for bicycles adopted by the U.S. Consumer Product
                                        Safety Commission, 16 C.F.R. Part 1512.</p>
                                    <p>3. All class three electric power-assisted bicycles shall be equipped with a
                                        speedometer that displays the speed the bicycle is traveling in miles per hour.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>D. No person shall tamper with or modify an electric power-assisted bicycle so as
                                        to change the motor-powered speed capability or engagement of an electric
                                        power-assisted bicycle, unless the label required by subdivision C 1 is replaced
                                        after modification.</p>
                                    <p>E. An electric power-assisted bicycle shall operate in a manner such that the
                                        electric motor is disengaged or ceases to function when the rider stops pedaling
                                        or when the brakes are applied.</p>
                                    <p>F. Except as set forth in this subsection, an electric power-assisted bicycle may
                                        be ridden in places where bicycles are allowed, including streets, highways,
                                        roads, shoulders, bicycle lanes, and bicycle or shared-use paths.</p>
                                    <p>1. Following notice and a public hearing, a locality or state agency having
                                        jurisdiction over a bicycle or shared-use path may prohibit the operation of
                                        class one or class two electric power-assisted bicycles on such path, if it
                                        finds that such a restriction is necessary for public safety or compliance with
                                        other laws.</p>
                                    <p>2. A locality or state agency having jurisdiction over a bicycle or shared-use
                                        path may prohibit the operation of class three electric power-assisted bicycles
                                        on such path.</p>
                                    <p>3. A locality or state agency having jurisdiction over a trail may regulate the
                                        use of electric power-assisted bicycles on such trail. For purposes of this
                                        subdivision, "trail" means a trail that is specifically designated as
                                        nonmotorized and that has a natural surface tread that is made by clearing and
                                        grading the native soil with no added surfacing materials.</p>
                                    <p>G. Each operator and passenger of a class three electric power-assisted bicycle
                                        shall wear a properly fitted and fastened bicycle helmet that meets the current
                                        standards provided by either the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission or the
                                        American Society for Testing and Materials International. Failure to wear a
                                        helmet shall not constitute negligence, be considered in mitigation of damages
                                        of whatever nature, be admissible in evidence, or be the subject of comment by
                                        counsel in any action for the recovery of damages arising out of the operation,
                                        ownership, or maintenance of a class three electric power-assisted bicycle, nor
                                        shall anything in this section change any existing law, rule, or procedure
                                        pertaining to any civil action, nor shall this section bar any claim that
                                        otherwise exists.</p>

                                        roadway operation. The Commonwealth Transportation Board may not prohibit the
                                        use of a personal delivery device on a roadway under its jurisdiction as set
                                        forth in this subsection but may by regulation adopt additional requirements
                                        designed to maintain safety for such roadway operation.</p>

                                    <p>2. Obey all traffic and pedestrian control devices and signs;</p>
                                    <p>3. Operate at a speed that does not exceed 10 miles per hour on sidewalks and
                                        crosswalks;</p>
                                    <p>4. Include a unique identifying device number;</p>
                                    <p>5. Include a means of identifying the personal delivery device operator that is
                                        in a position and of such a size to be clearly visible; and</p>
                                    <p>6. Be equipped with a braking system that, when active or engaged, will enable
                                        such personal delivery device to come to a controlled stop.</p>
                                    <p>C. Any personal delivery device transporting hazardous materials shall comply
                                        with the federal Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (49 U.S.C. ยง 5101 et

                                    <p>D. Subject to the requirements of this section, a personal delivery device
                                        operating on a sidewalk or crosswalk shall have all the rights and

                                    <p>A. The driver of any vehicle on a highway shall stop when any pedestrian crossing

                                    <p>B. When a vehicle is stopped pursuant to subsection A, the driver of any other

                                        shall not overtake and pass such stopped vehicle.</p>

                                    <p>No pedestrian shall enter or cross an intersection in disregard of approaching

                                        Church, and the Town of Ashland may by ordinance provide for the installation
                                        and maintenance of highway signs at marked crosswalks specifically requiring
                                        operators of motor vehicles, at the locations where such signs are installed, to
                                        yield the right-of-way to or stop for pedestrians crossing or attempting to
                                        cross the highway. Any operator of a motor vehicle who fails to comply with the
                                        signs installed pursuant to this subsection shall be guilty of a traffic
                                        infraction punishable by a fine of no less than $100 or more than $500. The

                                    <p>E. Where a shared-use path crosses a highway at a clearly marked crosswalk and
                                        there are no traffic control signals at such crossing, the local governing body
                                        may by ordinance require pedestrians, cyclists, and any other users of such
                                        shared-used path to come to a complete stop prior to entering such crosswalk.
                                        Such local ordinance may provide for a fine not to exceed $100 for violations.
                                        Any locality adopting such an ordinance shall install and maintain stop signs,
                                        consistent with standards adopted by the Commonwealth Transportation Board and
                                        to the extent necessary in coordination with the Department of Transportation.
                                        At such crosswalks, no user of such shared-use path shall enter the crosswalk in
