Content:
Low-speed vehicles may be operated on public highways where the maximum speed limit is no greater than 35 miles per hour, but this limitation shall not prohibit the operation of low-speed vehicles across intersections with highways whose maximum speed limits are greater than 35 miles per hour. Operation of low-speed vehicles shall be prohibited on any highway where the Department of Transportation or the local governing body of the locality having control of the highway, as the case may be, has prohibited their operation in the interest of safety and such prohibition is indicated by conspicuously posted signs.
Low-speed vehicles shall be operated on public highways only by persons who hold driver's licenses or learner's permits issued as provided in Chapter 3 (§ 46.2-300 et seq.).
Low-speed vehicles shall be titled and registered as provided in Chapter 6 (§ 46.2-600 et seq.) and shall be subject to the same requirements as to insurance applicable to other motor vehicles under that chapter.
On or after October 1, 2013, low-speed vehicles titled and registered as provided in Chapter 6 (§ 46.2-600 et seq.) shall display license plates as provided in subsection D of § 46.2-711.
The operator of any low-speed vehicle being operated on the highways in the Commonwealth shall have in his possession: (i) the registration card issued by the Department or the registration card issued by the state or country in which the low-speed vehicle is registered, and (ii) his driver's license, learner's permit, or temporary driver's permit.
The provisions of Article 22 (§ 46.2-1176 et seq.) of Chapter 10 of this title shall not apply to low-speed vehicles.
