Title: ยง 46.2-880. Tables of speed and stopping distances.
Content:
All courts shall take notice of the following tables of speed and stopping distances of motor vehicles, which shall not raise a presumption, in actions in which inquiry thereon is pertinent to the issues:









The courts shall further take notice that the above table has been constructed, using scientific reasoning, to provide factfinders with an average baseline for motor vehicle stopping distances: (1) for a vehicle in good condition and (2) on a level, dry stretch of highway, free from loose material.
Deviations from these circumstances do not negate the usefulness of the table, but rather call for additional site-specific examination and/or explanation.
Site-specific research may be utilized under any circumstances.
