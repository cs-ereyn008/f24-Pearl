Additionally, the provisions of § 46.2-888 shall not apply to such rural mail carrier so stopping if, in lieu of such sign, the vehicle has, and is using, supplemental turn signals mounted at each side of the roof of the vehicle. Between the lights on the assembly shall be mounted a sign with the words "U.S. Mail", or at least one flashing amber warning light, mounted on the roof or rear of the vehicle, to be used in conjunction with a rear-mounted "U.S. Mail" sign.
The roof-mounted "U.S. Mail" sign required by the foregoing provisions of this section shall be yellow with black letters at least four inches in height, and the lights shall be of the type approved by the Superintendent of State Police. The lettered sign shall be displayed only when the vehicle is engaged in the collection or delivery of the United States mail.
